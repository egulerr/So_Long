# So_Long
So_Long is that involves creating a 2D game using the minilibx graphics library. The game consists of a player that must navigate through a map while avoiding obstacles and collecting items.

## How to Use
To use the So_Long program, you need to follow these steps:

+ Download or clone the So_Long repository from GitHub.
+ Compile the program by running ```make``` in the root directory of the repository.
+ Start the game by running ./so_long [map_path].
+ The game will start, and you can use the arrow keys to move the player.
+ Navigate through the map, collect items, and avoid obstacles to reach the end.

The So_Long program uses the minilibx graphics library to display the game on the screen. The map is loaded from a file specified by the map_path argument. The game features a player character that can move in four directions and interact with items and obstacles on the map.

## Conclusion
The So_Long project is an excellent way to learn about graphics programming and game development in C. By implementing this program, you will gain experience with the minilibx library, file I/O, and game mechanics.
